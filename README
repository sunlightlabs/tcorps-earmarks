Letter
* A user's analysis / interpretation / cutting-and-pasting / response in
  response to a source document.
  
Setup:
  rake db:create
  rake db:migrate
  rake data:restore:all
  
Processing a legislator's documents:

  - Figure out the legislator's CSS rule, and add it to data/earmark_letter_sources.yml, along with the legislator's name and page URL.
  - Run "rake data:directory:fetch", this will create a YAML file inside data/generated, with URLs to the discovered PDFs. Verify that these URLs are correct, and are URL encoded correctly.
  - Run "rake data:directory:load_into_db", this loads the YAML file into the DB.  It is idempotent, and will not create duplicate legislators (indexed by name) or source docs (indexed by URL).
  - Run "rake data:scribd:populate", this uploads each document to scribd, and saves the scribd information to the SourceDoc.
  - Run "rake data:scribd:update_plain_text" to use the Scribd API to get the plain text for each document. You may want to wait a little bit so that Scribd has time to finish processing the documents you uploaded in step 4. If a document hasn't yet been processed by Scribd, the rake task will let you know its status, and you can try running it again later.
  - Run "rake data:backup:all" to backup the Legislator and SourceDoc tables to YAML.  These can be committed to the repository. This may be useful so that your staging or production machines do not have to go through all these steps, and can use the same Scribd documents you've already created.
    * If you add more columns to either model, that you want to have backed up, edit lib/data_backup_helper.rb and update the arrays of stored fields.
  - To restore the data you've backed up (like on a staging or production machine, for example), run "rake data:restore:all"
