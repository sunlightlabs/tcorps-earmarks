    BARNES - AASTAD\n\n\
    Research Initiatives in Support of USDA-ARS The North Central Soil Conservation Research Lab., Morris, MN (NCSCRL) Statement of The Barnes-Aastad Soil & Water Conservation Research Association\n\n\
    The research program at the NCSCRL experienced a flat budget and a drastic loss of scientific expertise during the last 10 years. The need is urgent to re-invigorate this stand-alone research unit and re-build a strong and integrated crops/soils research program at the Lab. The scientific and applied research carried out by this Lab serves and benefits a wide range of stakeholders and customers, not only in the immediate rural communities, but throughout the Midwest and the rest of the nation. The diminishing budget and loss of scientific expertise will force the research lab to be less focused on field and on-farm research with immediate and direct economic, environmental and developmental benefits to farmers, producers and the rural communities. Therefore, and in support of the Lab\xE2\x80\x99s mission, the Barnes-Aastad Association requests permanent funding in 2010 to fill four research positions (research agricultural economist, research hydrologist, climate change scientist and cropping systems ecologist). A stakeholders\xE2\x80\x99 meeting in 2008 identified these positions to help improve the economic return to agricultural producers and enhance sustainability of agricultural enterprises in the upper Midwest. Also, these positions will help reinvigorate an interdisciplinary research team after the loss of four research oppositions during the last seven years. The agricultural economist is needed to provide farmers and the local communities with badly needed research-based answers and solutions to production problems leading to the degradation and depreciation of natural resources that support the development of agriculture and rural America. The research hydrologist will provide farmers and producers with a better understanding of the quantity, quality and dynamics of water resources in relation to soil and landscape characteristics and management practices, especially in biomass production for bioenergy, and will help farmers achieve the double objective of maximum sustainable yields and maximum long-term profit of their operations. The climate change research scientist will help consolidate the unique position of the Lab in Morris to collect, evaluate and quantify data on carbon storage and ecosystem effects across a unique range of soil types, climate, and farm management systems. Finally, the cropping systems ecologist is needed to apply ecological scientific principles to the design and management of sustainable agro-ecosystems in a holistic approach, linking ecology, socioeconomics, and culture to help sustain agricultural production and environmental health.\n\n\

  title: Ultra Light Utility Vehicles (ULUVs) for the National Guard
  updated_at: 2009-07-08 03:24:10 Z
  plain_text: "19 March, 2009 Congressman Collin Peterson 2211 Rayburn HOB Washington, DC 20515 Reference: FY10 Project Request Titled \xE2\x80\x9CPolaris Defense Ultra Light Utility Vehicles (ULUVs) For The National Guard\xE2\x80\x9D Congressman Peterson, Polaris respectfully submitted an FY10 Project request for the purchase of Ultra Light Utility Vehicles (ULUVs) For The National Guard. In December of 2008, the National Guard added Ultra Light Utility Vehicles to their FY10 \xE2\x80\x9CTop 25\xE2\x80\x9D Equipment Modernization Shortfall List. Signed by LTG Clyde Vaughn, Chief of the Army National Guard, this addition to the Top 25 list confirms the critical need for lighter, smaller, more cost effective vehicles to perform logistics and support functions, as well as homeland security functions, both at home and in the Global War on Terrorism. This request provides funding for Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) All Terrain Ultra Light Utility Vehicles (ULUV) - which can and do meet this critical need today. This request Provides Value For The Taxpayer because: \xEF\x82\xB7 ULUVs Are Affordable And Cost Effective\xE2\x80\x93 at less than $20k unit cost\xE2\x80\x93 they are a fraction of the cost of one HMMWV. These vehicles can do a number of the missions currently being accomplished using the HMMWV, cheaper, and in many cases better \xE2\x80\x93 freeing them up for combat critical missions. Dual Use Nature Of ULUVs Well Suited For Needs Of The National Guard - As the Guard is called upon to go to war, as well as called upon at home, the DUAL USE nature of these vehicles make the need all the greater. 14 States have expressed a need for these vehicles, including South Dakota. Many TAGs have written letters to LTG Clyde Vaughn in support of the purchase of ULUVs. ULUVs Provide Mission Flexibility - ULUVs are highly capable, highly versatile vehicles that will continue to be needed to support Defense Department, State and Homeland Security operations and have been used extensively by all the Services in both CONUS and OCONUS operations. With the ability to operate in rugged off road conditions, at high altitudes without modification, these vehicles have truly gone wherever our forces wanted to go. They have been used in the homeland mission for drug interdiction, perimeter security, range control, flight-line support, MPs, base ops, public works and many other missions. ULUVs Have A Lighter Environmental Footprint \xE2\x80\x93 Given ULUVs are significantly smaller and lighter than Humvees, SUVs and Trucks, they have a significantly lighter environmental footprint. This is important on test ranges, training sites and many other areas where the National Guard operates.\n\n\
    \xEF\x82\xB7\n\n\

    \xEF\x82\xB7\n\n\
    This project is a good example of why the earmark process can be effectively utilized to field vehicles that are needed and supported by the National Guard , but given they don\xE2\x80\x99t have their own procurement budgets, some times takes many years to accomplish. Funding this project will accomplish this sooner, and help provide fuel to maintain Polaris as a world leader in off-road vehicles, both for the military and commercial markets. Thank you for your support,\n\n\
    Mark McCormick Managing Director Polaris Defense\n\n\

    Dear Chairman Obey & Ranking Member Lewis: I am requesting $5,400,000 for Adaptive Robotics Technology for Space, Air and Missiles [ART-SAM] in fiscal year 2010. The entity to receive funding for this project is Calhoun Community College, located at 6250 US Highway 31 North, Tanner, AL 35671. The funding would be used for a joint venture with leadership from the U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command (SMDC) and Alabama Industrial Development Training (AIDT), and will establish national robotics research and development capability at Calhoun Community College to leverage government, industry, and academia partnerships and their respective investments. Additionally, funds will be used to procure instrumentation, components and test fixtures to provide a hands-on laboratory for experiments and process testing in an unmanned environment. Taxpayer Justification: The ART-SAM project, once operational, will develop robotics technologies, systems and products for a variety of SMDC projects, programs, and core mission needs. It will serve as an economic development catalyst for robotic research and development, training, operations and manufacturing. It will also support workforce development initiatives throughout the state. I certify that neither I nor my spouse has any direct financial interest in this project. Also, I hereby certify that this request will be made publicly available on my Official Website as required by Chairman Obey\xE2\x80\x99s new Committee policy that only posted requests will be considered. Consistent with the Republican Leadership\xE2\x80\x99s policy on earmarks, I hereby certify that to the best of my knowledge this request (1) is not directed to an entity or program that will be named after a sitting Member of Congress; (2) is not intended to be used by an entity to secure funds for other entities unless the use of funding is consistent with the specified purpose of the earmark; and (3) meets or exceeds all statutory requirements for matching funds where applicable. I further certify that should this request be included in the bill, I will place a statement in the Congressional Record describing how the funds will be spent and justifying the use of federal taxpayer funds.

    Chairman David Obey House Appropriations Committee H-218, the Capitol Washington, DC 20515\n\n\
    Ranking Member Jerry Lewis House Appropriations Committee 1016 Longworth House Office Building Washington, DC 20515\n\n\
    Dear Chairman Obey & Ranking Member Lewis: I am requesting $6,000,000 for Rapid Missile All-Source Analysis in fiscal year 2010. The entity to receive funding for this project is Clean Earth Technologies, located at 13378 Lakefront Drive, Earth City, MO 63045, with an office also at 4910 Corporate Drive, Suite J, Huntsville, Alabama 35805. The funding would be used to continue implementation of a new generation of tools, infrastructure and processes to rapidly process and evaluate all-source missile event data. This capability will allow quick reaction analysis of missile events as they occur and also materially contribute to reducing the backlog of unanalyzed all-source intelligence data. This will significantly enhance timely policy and war fighter support. The initiative will specifically address the critical need to accurately analyze high-priority threat missile systems and to avoid battle field surprise. Taxpayer Justification: This capability permits efficient and timely analysis of all source data from missile events around the world. Clean Earth would be one of a team of companies engaged in an effort to significantly reduce the time required by intelligence analysis to evaluate missile events. The result will better war fighter support, and more efficient application of taxpayer dollars (in terms of personnel assignment and use of equipement). I certify that neither I nor my spouse has any direct financial interest in this project. Also, I hereby certify that this request will be made publicly available on my Official Website as required by Chairman Obey\xE2\x80\x99s new Committee policy that only posted requests will be considered.

    Dear Chairman Obey & Ranking Member Lewis: I am requesting $1,000,000.00 for Miniature Antennas for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles in fiscal year 2010. The entity to receive funding for this project is The University of Alabama, located at The University of Alabama, PO Box 870117, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487. The funding would be used to investigate the unstable imaging problems existing in UAV\xE2\x80\x99s camera with novel ferrites & broadband ferrite antennas of unique design. The goal is to develop minature antennas that are capable of supporting systems that control the flight of UAV\xE2\x80\x99s. Taxpayer Justification: Lessons from recent combat experiences show that UAV\xE2\x80\x99s can improve acquisition & rapid dissemination of intelligence, surveillance & reconnaissance data. There is a need to increase the amounts of communication bandwidth to utilize the full potential of UAV\xE2\x80\x99s. I certify that neither I nor my spouse has any direct financial interest in this project. Also, I hereby certify that this request will be made publicly available on my Official Website as required by Chairman Obey\xE2\x80\x99s new Committee policy that only posted requests will be considered. Consistent with the Republican Leadership\xE2\x80\x99s policy on earmarks, I hereby certify that to the best of my knowledge this request (1) is not directed to an entity or program that will be named after a sitting Member of Congress; (2) is not intended to be used by an entity to secure funds for other entities unless the use of funding is consistent with the specified purpose of the earmark; and (3) meets or exceeds all statutory requirements for matching funds where applicable. I further certify that should this request be included in the bill, I will place a statement in the Congressional Record describing how the funds will be spent and justifying the use of federal taxpayer funds. Sincerely,\n\n\

    The Honorable Jerry Lewis, Ranking Member House Appropriations Committee 1016 Longworth Washington DC 20515\n\n\
    Dear Chairman Obey and Ranking Member Lewis, I am requesting funding in the FY2010 Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies Appropriations bill, Department of Justice, Juvenile Justice account for KidsVoice. The entity to receive funding for this project is KidsVoice at 437 Grant Street, Suite 700, Pittsburgh Pennsylvania, 15219. It is my understanding that the funding would be used to increase their impact in the community and to support programs that are offered to abused and neglected children in Allegheny County. In addition, KidsVoice seeks to increase its impact by expanding services that will help clients become productive adults, despite the obstacles they face. The funding will expand KidsVoice efforts in assisting foster youth to pursue post-secondary education, job training and employment. I certifY that this project does not have a direct andforeseeable effect on the pecuniary interests of me or my spouse. Consistent with the Republican Leadership's policy on earmarks, I hereby certifY that to the best of my knowledge this request (I) is not directed to an entity or program that will be named after a sitting Member of Congress; (2) is not intended to be used by an entity to secure funds for other entities unless the use of funding is consistent with the specified purpose of the earmark; and (3) meets or exceeds all statutory requirements for matching funds where applicable. I further certify that should this request be included in the bill, I will place a statement in the Congressional Record describing how the funds will be spent and justifying the use of federal taxpayer funds.\n\n\

The agency seeks funding for a project that is two-fold. The first portion of the project is based upon clearly needed and effective communication. The City of Middletown Police department is a 77 member agency that for many years now has attempted to survive with the very bare essentials as far as communications. The second part of the Technology request lies with both a manner in which the Police Departments administration can constantly monitor vehicle stops and ensure proper procedure, witll protection against false litigious claims. This agency has had to deal with a serious increase in violent crime, and has attempted to use every available resource to deal with it, be it multi-agency cooperation, or the seeking of funding on a State level for increased overtime and equipment. A priority of the police department is to maintain a progressive stance on crime and Witll the assistance of Federal funding it can continue to attempt to decrease the instances of violent crime, and in tlle end, improve the lives of the citizens of the City of Middletown. I certify that neitller I nor my spouse has any financial interest in this project. Thank you for your consideration of my request.\n\n\

    Dear Chairman Mollohan and Ranking Member Wolf, Thank you for your leadership on the Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, and Science. I am requesting funding for the Truancy Response and Intervention Program in Weld County, Colorado in fiscal year 2010. The entity to receive funding for this project is the Weld County Juvenile Assessment Center located at 2835 lOth Street, Greeley, Colorado 80634. The funding for this project is a good use of taxpayer funds because it will be used to reduce truant behavior in Weld County, behavior which in tum influences high school graduation rates, drains school and community resources, and leads to criminal conduct and penetration into the criminal justice system. I certify that neither I nor my spouse has any financial interest in this project.\n\n\

    This is to request $8,500,000 in the Fiscal Year 2010 Commerce, Justice, Science Appropriations bill; Office of Justice Programs, Byrne Discretionary Grants account, for the National Forensic Science Training Center. The entity that will receive funding under this request is The National Forensic Science Technology Center, 7881 114th Avenue North, Largo, FL 33773. It is my understanding that the funding would be used by this Department of Justice-selected Forensic Technology Center of Excellence to continue to provide for the Office of Justice Programs an assessment program to audit the capabilities and quality of DNA laboratories throughout the United States which receive agency funding.

I certify that this project does not have a direct or foreseeable effect on the pecuniary interests of me or my spouse. Consistent with the Republican Leadership\xE2\x80\x99s policy on earmarks, I hereby certify that to the best of my knowledge this request (1) is not directed to an entity or program named or that will be named after a sitting Member of Congress; (2) is not intended to be used by an entity to secure funds for other entities unless the use of funding is consistent with the specified purpose of the earmark; and (3) meets or exceeds all statutory requirements for matching funds where applicable. I further certify that should this request be included in the bill, I will place a statement in the Congressional Record describing how the funds will be spent and justifying the use of federal taxpayer funds. (4) I hereby certify that this request will be made publicly available on my Official Website as required by Chairman Obey\xE2\x80\x99s new Committee policy that only posted requests will be considered.

    April 01,2009 The Honorable David R. Obey, Chairman The Honorable Jerry Lewis, Ranking Member Committee on Appropriations H-218, The Capitol Washington, D.C. 20515 Dear Chairman Obey and Ranking Member Lewis: I am requesting funding for DA Gang and Drug Crime Investigation and Prosecution in fiscal year 2010. The entity to receive funding for this project is: County of San Diego, District Attorney 330 West Broadway San Diego, CA 92101 The funding would be used for the investigation and prosecution of gang-related crime and drug crime by the San Diego County Office of the District Attorney. San Diego County is facing massive budget cuts as a result of California's mUlti-billion dollar deficit. The Office of the District Attorney alone must cut its budget by $12-million\" which will directly impact the office's ability to successfully investigate and prosecute gang-related crime and drug crime. At a time when the budget for gang and drug crime fighting is decreasing, the incidence and severity of gang and drug crime in San Diego County is on the rise. I certify that neither I nor my spouse has any financial interest in this project.\n\n\

    The Honorable David Obey Chairman House Committee on Appropriations H218 The Capitol Washington, DC 20515 Dear Chairman Obey: I am requesting funding for Orlando Health Orange County Children's Advocacy Center Programs in fiscal year 2010. The entity to receive funding for this project is Orlando Health Foundation, located at 3160 Southgate Commerce Blvd., Orlando, FL 32806. The funding would be used for the Orange County Children's Advocacy Center (CAC), who in the last year, provided advocacy to 1,649 young victims, siblings and non-offending caregivers. The program also provided investigation and prosecution services for 3,939 clients and mental health counseling to 926 clients. This program provides more than 28,000 services to clients each year including advocacy, crisis intervention, lethality assessments, non-offending caregiver support and education, and mental health counseling. Clients are referred to the onsite Healing Tree program for specialized mental health treatment. This program implements a family systems model, which treats not only the child victims but also siblings and non-offending caretakers, thus helping to ensure that the family is able to recover in a supportive, healthy environment together. This request is to ensure that the thousands of families that experience child abuse each year in Orange County, Florida are able to access the services needed to help them recover and heal. Funding will be used to sustain existing Child Advocates and Therapists and other costs, as well as expand the program's capacity to provide services with the addition of two Child Advocates and four Therapists. I celiify that neither I nor my spouse has any financial interest in this project. Sincerely,\n\n\

    Dear Chairman Mollohan and Ranking Member Wolf: I am requesting funding for the Metagenomic Analysis of Chesapeake Bay (MAC B) Initiative in the fiscal year 2010 bill. The entity to receive funding for this project is the University of Maryland Biotechnology Institute (UMBI), located at 9600 Gudelsky Drive, Rockville, MD 20850. This request will provide funds for a collaborative effort to undertake a genomic analysis of the Chesapeake Bay to comprehensively examine all of the key microbial processes that govern the Bay's community dynamics and health. UMBl's MACB Initiative will apply high-end molecular approaches and functional genomics with meta data that will elucidate the dynamics and interactions of the seasonal microbial processes that are essential in nutrient cycling and removal of pollutants from the Bay. Using archived environmental DNA samples spanning a 20year period, long-term changes in microbial communities will be assessed and the changes discovered will lend greater clues to what is happening in the Bay and how to improve Bay conditions. Expected outcomes will be profiles that demonstrate community activity under normal and stress conditions as well as provide potential bioremediation markers for natural and accelerated bioremediation of pollutants in the Bay. Funding will also support the purchase of instrumentation and equipment upgrades for the BioAnalytical Services Lab. The BAS Lab is the only lab in the State of Maryland with a comprehensive focus on analytical, synthetic and separation projects for the Chesapeake Bay. I certify that neither I nor my spouse has any financial interest in this project. Sincerely,\n\n\

    The Honorable Jerry Lewis Ranking Member House Appropriations Committee 1016 Longworth HOB Washington, DC 20515\n\n\
    I write to respectfully request funding in the Fiscal Year 2010 Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies Appropriations bill, Department of Justice, COPS Law Enforcement Technology account. The entity to receive funding for this project is the City of Hialeah, located at 501 Palm Avenue, Hialeah, FL 33010. It is my understanding that the funding would be used to enhance the City of Hialeah police department's current radio system which does not allow for radio interoperability among other law enforcement agencies, especially important during times of statewide response to natural disasters, domestic security incidents or multi-agency jurisdictional public safety efforts. The XPS radio system would bridge the current gap and achieve interoperability with the State of Florida by replacing and upgrading fixed end, portable and mobile radio communication equipment. I certify that this project does not have a direct andforeseeable effect on the pecuniary interests ofme or my spouse.\n\n\

    March 28, 2009 The Honorable David R. Obey, Chairman The Honorable Jerry Lewis, Ranking Member Committee on Appropriations H-218, The Capitol Washington, D.C. 20515 Dear Chairman Obey and RankingMember Lewis: I am requesting funding for Protecting the Health and Building a Prosperous Future for At-Risk Youth in New York City in fiscal year 2010. The entity to receive funding for this project is: Gay Men's Health Crisis, Inc. (GMHC) 119 West 24th Street New York City, NY 10011 The funding would be used for the support of the launch by the Gay Men's Health Crisis, Inc. (GMHC) of a multiyear HIV prevention campaign for at-risk youth. This prevention effort would include social marketing campaigns, online interventions, educational workshops and activities, and special testing events. Once GMHC reaches these at-risk young people via its prevention campaign, they would have access to GMHC's wide continuum of care services, whether they are HIV-positive or at risk of infection. These services, which both serve to reduce the spread of HIV and support at-risk youth, include substance use and mental health counseling, meals and nutrition, treatment adherence counseling, legal services, GED training and workforce development, social support and networking, and client advocacy services. I certify that neither I nor my spouse has any financial interest in this project.\n\n\

I nnther celiify that should this request be included in the bill, I will place a statement in the Congressional Record describing how the nmds will be spent and justifying the use of federal taxpayer nll1ds.

The proposed recipient of funding for this project is: Town of Vernon 14 Park Place Vernon, CT 06066 Requested funding would be used to replace outdated analog radio equipment for local law enforcement with upgraded digital communications equipment. If funded, the project would help address a critical gap in the safety of the Vernon community and ensure that law enforcement personnel can communicate during response to emergencies. Federal support would ease the burden faced by the town during a period of strained municipal budgets, as well as advancing federal support of our first responders and the safety of local communities. I certify that neither I nor my spouse has any financial interest in this project. Thank you for your consideration of this request. Sincerely,\n\n\

    March 30, 2009 The Honorable David R. Obey Chairman Committee on Appropriations U.S. House of Representatives H-218 U.S. Capitol. Washington, DC 20515 Dear Chairman Obey and Ranking Member Lewis: I am requesting $325,000 for the Mobile Data Computer Infrastructure. The entity to receive funding for this project is the City of Escondido located at: 201 North Broadway Escondido, CA 92008 The Escondido Police Department is seeking funding for 65 new Mobile Data Computers (MDCs). The Police Department currently maintains approximately 160 MDCs. About 40 percent of these are three to four years old and are used beyond the manufacturers warranty period. Although these MDCs are still in the field and functioning, they are very costly to maintain. Consistent with the Republican Leadership's policy on earmarks, I hereby certify that to the best of my knowledge this request (1) is not directed to an entity or program named or will be named after a sitting Member of Congress (2) is not intended for a \"front\" or \"pass through\" entity; and (3) meets or exceeds all statutory requirements for matching funds where applicable. I further certify that should this request be included in the bill, I will place a statement in the Congressional Record describing how the funds will be spent and justifying the use of federal taxpayer funds. I certify that neither I, nor my spouse, have any financial interest in this project. The Honorable Jerry Lewis Ranking Member Committee on Appropriations U.S. House of Representatives 1016 Longworth House Office Building. Washington, DC 20515\n\n\

    I am requesting funding in the FY2010 Commerce, Justice, and Science Appropriations bill. The entity to receive funding for this project is the Nassau County Police Depm1ment, located at 1490 Franklin Avenue, Mineola, NY 11501.

I certify that this project does not have a direct and foreseeable effect on the pecuniary interests of my spouse or me. I hereby certify that this request will be made publicly available on my official website as required by Chairman Obey's new Committee policy that only posted requests will be considered. Consistent with the Republican Leadership's policy on earmarks, I hereby certify that to the best of my knowledge this request: (1) is not directed to an entity or program that will be named after a sitting Member of Congress; (2) is not intended to be used by an entity to secure funds for other entities unless the use of funding is consistent with the specified purpose of the earmark; and (3) meets or exceeds all statutory requirements for matching funds where applicable. I further certify that should this request be included in the bill, I will place a statement in the Congressional Record describing how the funds will be spent and justifying the use of federal taxpayer funds.

The entity to receive funding for this project is the University of Alabama, Office for Research, Box 870117, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487.

I hereby certify that this request will be made publicly available on my Official Website as required by Chairman Obey's new Committee policy that only posted requests will be considered. Consistent with the Republican Leadership's policy on earmarks, I hereby certify that to the best of my knowledge this request: (1) is not directed to an entity or program that will be named after a sitting Member of Congress; (2) is not intended to be used by an entity to secure funds for other entities unless the use of funding is consistent with the specified purpose of the earmark; and (3) meets or exceeds all statutory requirements for matching funds where applicable.

    The Honorable Jerry Lewis Ranking Member House Appropriations Committee 1016 Longworth HOB Washington, DC 20515\n\n\
    I write to respectfully request funding in the Fiscal Year 2010 Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies Appropriations bill, Department of Justice, COPS Law Enforcement Technology account. The entity to receive funding for this project is the City of Hialeah, located at 501 Palm Avenue, Hialeah, FL 33010. It is my understanding that the funding would be used to enhance the City of Hialeah police department's current radio system which does not allow for radio interoperability among other law enforcement agencies, especially important during times of statewide response to natural disasters, domestic security incidents or multi-agency jurisdictional public safety efforts. The XPS radio system would bridge the current gap and achieve interoperability with the State of Florida by replacing and upgrading fixed end, portable and mobile radio communication equipment. I certify that this project does not have a direct andforeseeable effect on the pecuniary interests ofme or my spouse.\n\n\
    PRINllOb ON FI\xC2\xA3CVCLEC PAPER\n\n\
    \fConsistent with the Republican Leadership's policy on earmarks, I hereby certify that to the best of my knowledge this request (1) is not directed to an entity or program that will be named after a sitting Member of Congress; (2) is not intended to be used by an entity to secure funds for other entities unless the use of funding is consistent with the specified purpose of the earmark; and (3) meets or exceeds all statutory requirements for matching funds where applicable. I further certify that should this request be included in the bill, I will place a statement in the Congressional Record describing how the funds will be spent and jus' .ng the use of federal taxpayer funds.\n\n\

    The Honorable David R. Obey, Chainnan The Honorable JeITY Lewis, Ranking Member Committee on Appropriations H-218, The Capitol Washington, D.C. 20515 Dear ChailTl1an Obey and Ranking Member Lewis: I am requesting funding for Center for Court Innovation: Enhanced Services for Veterans in Drug Court in fiscal year 2010. The entity to receive funding for this project is: Center for Court Innovation 520 8th Ave., 18th Floor, New York, NY 10018 The funding for tlus program will be used to develop specialized protocols for all fOlTl1er and CUlTent military combat personnel admitted to drug courts within tlle Mid-Hudson region. The project will develop recommendations and apply enhanced and targeted services to the veteran population. There are cUlTently 25 million veterans-and an additional 37 million dependents of those veterans-living in tlle United States, representing nearly 20% of the US population. In addition to veterans, there are many combat military members who have not yet been discharged but are between deployments, along with thousands of National Guard soldiers who have served a major role in bOtll Iraq and Afghanistan. While exact numbers are difficult to confinn, there is little question that a sigluficant number of New York's military who have served in war zones will find tllemselves facing criminal charges related to substance abuse and/or mental disorders that frequently stem from their military experience. I certify that neitller I nor my spouse has any financial interest in tllis project. Thank you for your consideration of my request.\n\n\

The entity to receive funding for this project is: County of San Diego, Sheriffs Department 9621 Ridgehaven Court San Diego, CA 92123 The funding would be used for the San Diego Regional Communications System (RCS), which has been in existence since 1998 and involves 215 public agencies. This project will move the County of San Diego and its cities forward in the implementation of an effective, efficient regional interoperable communications system. This system will be critical both in terms of daily, routine communications and during disaster emergencies and other events that demand that all public safety agencies be able to communicate effectively. It will benefit California and other States and Federal agencies by providing voice radio interoperability with those entering into the region providing mutual aid. Ultimately, it will enable San Diego County public safety agencies to seamlessly integrate with surrounding Counties as it is built out to a network of networks. I certify that neither I nor my spouse has any financial interest in this project.\n\n\

    weh,ire: www.house.govliilner\n\n\
    I am requesting funding for the San Diego County District Attorney Gang and Drug Crime Investigation and Prosecution program in fiscal year 2010. The entity to receive funding for this project is the San Diego County District Attorney's Office, located at: 330 West Broadway, San Diego, CA 92123. Funding would provide critical resources needed by the District Attorney's office to investigate and prosecute gang-related crime and drug crime. This project deserves federal funding because it is an essential government responsibility to stop cross-border drug and gang crimes in San Diego County. I certify that neither I nor my spouse has any financial interest in this project.\n\n\

    The Honorable David R Obey, Chairman The Honorable Jerry Lewis, Ranking Member Committee on Appropriations H-218, The Capitol Washington, D . C. 20515 Dear Chairman Obey and Ranking Member Lewis: I am requesting funding for Immigrant Women and Girls Legal Services in fiscal year 2010 . The entity to receive funding for this project is: Tahirih Justice Center 6402 Arlington Boulevard, Suite 300 Falls Church, VA 22042 This funding would be used to support pro bono direct legal services in Falls Church, Virginia, for immigrant women and girls fleeing gender-based violence . To respond to an urgent need for services to vulnerable immigrant women and girls, the Tahirih Justice Center seeks funding to (1) provide acutely needed direct legal services, as well as social and medical services referrals out of its Northern Virginia office, and (2) replicate its award-winning model for providing free legal services in Houston, TX. Despite the large immigrant population, Tahirih Justice Center is the only legal and social service provider in Virginia with an exclusive focus on the needs of immigrant women and girls from a wide range of cultures fleeing gender-based violence such as female genital mutilation, torture, rape, human trafficking, honor crimes, widow rituals, forced marriage, and domestic violence. Without the support of the Tahirih Justice Center attorneys and social workers, many would have nowhere to turn for assistance . I certify that neither I nor my spouse has any financial interest in this project Sincerely,\n\n\

    March 30, 2009 The Honorable David R. Obey Chairman Committee on Appropriations U.S. House of Representatives H-218 U.S. Capitol. Washington, DC 20515 Dear Chainnan Obey and Ranking Member Lewis: I am requesting $700,000 for District Attorney Gang and Drug Crime Investigation and Prosecution. The entity to receive funding for this project is the County of San Diego, District Attorney located at: 330 West Broadway San Diego, CA 92101 This project funds the investigation and prosecution of gang-related crime and drug crime by the San Diego County Office of the District Attorney. San Diego County is facing massive budget cuts as a result of California's multi-billion dollar deficit. The Office of the District Attorney alone must cut its budget by $12-million, which will directly impact the office's ability to successfully investigate and prosecute gang-related crime and drug crime. At a time when the budget for gang and drug crime fighting is decreasing, the incidence and severity of gang and drug crime in San Diego County is on the rise. Consistent with the Republican Leadership's policy on earmarks, I hereby certify that to the best of my knowledge this request (1) is not directed to an entity or program named or will be named after a sitting Member of Congress (2) is not intended for a \"front\" or \"pass through\" entity; and (3) meets or exceeds all statutory requirements for matching funds where applicable. I further certify that should this request be included in the bill, I will place a statement in the Congressional Record describing how the funds will be spent and justifying the use of federal taxpayer funds. I certify that neither I, nor my spouse, have any financial interest in this project. The Honorable Jerry Lewis Ranking Member Committee on Appropriations U.S. House of Representatives 1016 Longworth House Office Building. Washington, DC 20515\n\n\

    Dear Chairman Mollohan and Ranking Member Wolf:\n\n\
    I am requesting funding in the FY 10 Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations bill, under the Byrne Grant program for the City of Houston Police Department, located at 1200 Travis Street, Houston, TX 77002. It is my understanding that the funding would help the city purchase 50 additional handheld devices that would be given to police officers to quickly capture biometric information of suspects and quickly determine their criminal histories, outstanding warrants, whether they have an order of removal or bench warrant for a failure to appear for an immigration proceeding from Immigration and Customs Enforcement. I certify that neither I nor my spouse has any fInancial interest in this project.\n\
    Consistent with the Republican Leadership's policy on earmarks, I hereby certify that to the best of my knowledge this request (1) is not directed to an entity or program that will be named after a sitting Member of Congress; (2) is not intended to be used by an entity to secure funds for other entities unless the use of funding is consistent with the specifIed purpose of the earmark; and (3) meets or exceeds all statutory requirements for matching funds where applicable. I further certify that should this request be included in the bill, I will place a statement in the Congressional Record describing how the funds will be spent and justifying the use of federal taxpayer funds.\n\n\

    The Honorable Jerry Lewis Ranking Member House Appropriations Committee H-218 Capitol Washington, D.C. 20515\n\n\
    I am requesting funding for Engineering Support for Extended Human and Robotic Space Flight Missions in fiscal year 2010. The entity to receive funding for this project is Texas Tech University located at 2500 Broadway, Lubbock, TX 79409. It is my understanding that this funding will be used towards providing engineering support for extended human & robotic space flight missions, which will directly contribute to NASA's initiative of returning to the moon and going to mars. For human and robotic missions the Center for Space Sciences is addressing the need for a decreased reliance on mission control due to the communication delays that occur in long distance missions. I hereby certify that this request will be made publicly available on my official website as required. I certify that neither I nor my spouse has any financial interest in this project. I also certify that to the best of my knowledge this request (1) is not directed to an entity or program named or will be named after a sitting Member of Congress; (2) is not intended to be used by an entity to secure funds for other entities unless the use of funding is consistent with the specified purpose of the earmark; and (3) meets or exceeds all statutory requirements for matching funds where applicable. I further certify that should this request be included in the bill, I will place a statement in the Congressional Record describing how the funds will be spent and justifying the use of federal taxpayer funds. Thank you for your consideration of this request. Sincerely,\n\n\

    Dear Chairman Mollohan and Ranking Member Frelinghuysen: I am requesting funding for the City of Denton Regional Public Safety Training Facility for fiscal year 2010. The entity to receive funding for this project is the City of Denton, Texas located at 215 East McKinney, Denton, TX 76201. The funds will be used to equip the facility, including fire simulation equipment, computerized firearm targeting systems, classroom-based virtual reality simulation equipment and administrative/classroom multimedia equipment. I certify that neither I nor my spouse has any financial interest in this project. Consistent with the Republican Leadership's policy on earmarks, I hereby certify that to the best of my knowledge this request (I) is not directed to an entity or program named or will be named after a sitting Member of Congress (exception must be justified here); (2) is not intended for a \"front\" or \"pass through\" entity; and (3) meets or exceeds all statutory requirements for matching funds where applicable. I further certify that should this request be included in the bill, I will place a statement in the Congressional Record describing how the funds will be spent and justifying the use offederal taxpayer funds. Currently, I have established an internal process to ensure that these minimum requirements are met and believe that my criteria for evaluating these standards far exceed these GOP Conference standards. Should you require my internal forms I require any potential grantee to complete and certify or my own personal appropriations request criteria, please contact my staff and they will make them available to your staff.\n\n\

The entity to receive funding for this project is: Micronesian Legal Services Corporation P.O. Box 269 Saipan, MP 96950 Micronesian Legal Services Corporation (MLSC) is a private, non-profit law office that provides free legal assistance to low-income persons in civil matters. MLSC operates throughout Micronesia , with offices in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, the Republic of Palau, the Federated States of Micronesia , and the Marshall Islands. This funding will allow MLSC to serve the legal needs of low-income populations in Tinian and Rota, two islands with large low-income populations. These two islands are currently serviced by once-monthly visits from an MLSC attorney, but this service is not sufficient to meet the populations' legal needs. This funding will allow an attorney to provide dedicated service to these islands. I certify that neither I nor my spouse has any financial interest in this project.\n\n\

    Dear Chairman Obey and Ranking Member Lewis, I am requesting funding in the FYI0 Commerce, Justice, Science Appropriations bill, Office of Justice Programs' COPS-Meth account for Illinois State University. The entity to receive funding for this project is Illinois State University at Campus Box 4040, Hovey 310, Normal, Illinois 61790. It is my understanding this funding would be used to expand the program that Illinois State University has created in collaboration with Franklin County Juvenile Detention Center that addresses the epidemic of methamphetamine use through treatment of arrested juveniles from rural populations. I certify that this proj ect does not have a direct and foreseeable effect on the pecuniary interests of me or my spouse. I further certify that this request will be made publicly available on my Official Website as required by Chairman Obey's new committee policy that only posted requests will be considered. Consistent with the Republican Leadership's policy on earmarks, I hereby certify that to the best of my knowledge this request (1) is not directed to an entity or program that will be named after a sitting Member of Congress; (2) is not intended to be used by an entity to secure funds for other entities unless the use of funding is consistent with the specified purpose of the earmark; and (3) meets or exceeds all statutory requirements for matching funds where applicable. I further certify that should this request be included in the bill, I\n\n\
    PRINTED ON RECYCLED PAPER\n\n\

The entity to receive funding for this project is: Superior Court of California, County of Santa Clara 191 North 1st Street San Jose, CA 95113 The funding would be used for implementing the Delinquency Model Court Guidelines, which were established after three years of work by over 100 experts in juvenile justice. It is common for family relationships to dissolve once entangled in the juvenile justice system. These youth often become a ward of the state after entering delinquency court. By implementing the Delinquency Model Court Guidelines the system will provide greater support for these youth and their families through new methods of collaboration, resource sharing and restructuring some elements of the process. I certify that neither I nor my spouse has any financial interest in this project.\n\n\

The entity to receive funding for this project is: New York State Police 1791 State Route 209 Kingston NY 12401\n\n\
    If granted, tius project will have several benefits and have a great impact for tlie people of tlie Hudson Valley region. All the equipment requested will enable the NYSP dive team to conduct tlieir dive operations much more effectively and efficiently, increasing our ability to more successfully locate various different targets we may be asked to look for. In addition, tliis equipment will be used for any and all infrastructure, security and evaluation of sensitive targets. Within tlie Hudson Valley region, the NYSP dive team is responsible for, and/or assists in tlie response and protection of numerous mass transit venues, such as bridges, turmels and trains crossing the Hudson River. Many of tilese areas are remote in nature so they require a smaller vessel witli tile same amount of teclmological advantages that would be needed and desired on tile larger bodies of water. Many of these smaller bodies of water converge to support the reservoirs which supply much of tile drinking water to New York City.\n\
    I celiify timt neitiler I nor my spouse has any financial interest in this project. Thank you for your consideration of my request.\n\n\

    Dear Chairman Obey and Ranking Member Lewis, I am requesting funding in the FYlO Commerce, Justice, Science Appropriations bill, Depat1ment of Justice, Office of Justice Programs- Juvenile Justice Account for PACEWorks!. The entity to receive funding for this project is the PACE Center for Girls, Inc. at 1 West Adams Street, Suite 301, Jacksonville, FL 32202. It is my understanding that the funding would be used to integrate a vocational and life skills transition services program for at-risk young women. I certify that this project does not have a direct and foreseeable effect on the pecuniary interests of my spouse or me. I also certify that this request will be made publicly available on my Official Website. Consistent with the Republican Leadership's policy on earmarks, I hereby certify that to the best of my knowledge this request: (1) is not directed to an entity or program that will be named after a sitting Member of Congress; (2) is not intended to be used by an entity to secure funds for other entities unless the use of funding is consistent with the specified purpose of the earmark; and (3) meets or exceeds all statutory requirements for matching funds where applicable. I fut1her cet1ify that should this request be included in the bill, I will place a statement in the Congressional Record describing how the funds will be spent and justifying the use of federal taxpayer funds.\n\n\

    Dear Chairman Obey and Ranking Member Lewis: I am requesting funding for Gunshot Location System in fiscal year 2010. The entity to receive funding for this project is: New Bedford Police Department 871 Rockdale Ave New Bedford, MA 02740 The funding would be used for ShotS potter GLS which the New Bedford Police Department believes that is an essential tool in the City's war on crime and, based on crime analysis, we will be targeting the United Front West End neighborhood, where there has been a significant increase in the numbers of shots fired. Networked sensors will be placed at specific coordinates on buildings and telephone poles and cover a ten square mile area. The implementation of the ShotS potter GLS will enable the City to accurately detect and locate the origin of gunshots and weapons-events. Once a gunshot is detected, ShotS potter calculates the position where the gun was fired and sends the data to a central server accessible by law-enforcement agencies. Because ShotSpotter uses computer software to analyze sounds, ShotSpotter is precise enough to ignore fireworks, backfiring cars, and other noises that could be mistaken for gunfire. ~olice, sheriffs, the FBI and other law enforcement organizations nationwide have been successful in using ShotSpotter GLS to reduce crime. Specifically, in areas where the Gunshot Location System has been deployed there has been a decrease in gunfire ranging from 60 percent to 90 percent. ShotSpotter has also been responsible for producing countless arrests, decreasing police response time, increasing officer safety, pinpointing key forensic evidence, and saving numerous lives. I certify that I have no fmancial ~~ interest in this project. BARNEY FRANK BF/bf\n\n\

    The Honorable Jerry Lewis Ranking Member House Appropriations Committee 1016 Longworth HOB Washington, DC 20515\n\n\
    I write to respectfully request funding in the Fiscal Year 2010 Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies Appropriations bill, Department of Justice, COPS Law . Enforcement Technology account. The entity to receive funding for this project is Miami-Dade County Public Schools, located at 1450 NE Second Avenue, Miami, FL\n\n\
    33132.\n\
    It is my understanding that the funding would be used to upgrade law enforcement equipment for the Miami-Dade County Public Schools Police Department. In their mission to protect the children of our community, the MDCPS Police Department has increasingly turned to new technologies. In 2005, laptop computers were purchased through grants and installed in officer's vehicles. These upgrades allow officers to decrease paper-based work by 80% and spend considerably more time at the public schools. I certify that this project does not have a direct andforeseeable effect on the pecuniary interests of me or my spouse.\n\n\
    PRINTED ON RECYCU,LI PAF'i:F1.\n\n\
    \fConsistent with the Republican Leadership's policy on earmarks, I hereby certify that to the best of my knowledge this request (1) is not directed to an entity or program that will be named after a sitting Mem.ber of Congress; (2) is not intended to be used by an entity to secure funds for other entities unless the use of funding is consistent with the specified purpose of the earmark; and (3) meets or exceeds all statutory requirements for matching funds where applicable. I further certify that should this request be included in the bill, I will place a statement in the Congressional Record describing how the funds will be spent justif the use offederal taxpayer funds.\n\n\

    The Honorable Jerry Lewis Ranking Member House Appropriations Committee 1016 Longworth House Office Building Washington, D.C. 20515\n\n\
    I am requesting funding for the High-Risk Youth Program in fiscal year 2010. The entity to receive funding for this project is the Dakota Boys & Girls Ranch located at P.O. Box 5007, Minot, ND 58702. A model national program that targets high-risk elementary students, ages 6 to 12, has been piloted in the Fargo, North Dakota school district. The program uses integrated child-, school- and family-focused interventions to move high-risk children toward a pathway to success. The program has resulted in gains in academic achievement, reductions in behavior problems, and improvements in social skills and social adaptability. This funding would be used to expand the reach of this successful program to other parts of the state. I certify that I do not have any financial interest in this project.\n\n\

    I am requesting funding in the FY201 0 Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations bill for the Utah Meth Cops Program. The entity to receive funding is the American Detoxification Foundation, located at 3090 S. Main Street, Salt Lake City, UT 841 15, It is my understanding that the funding would be used to treat law enforcement officers that are experiencing detrimental health effects from their exposure, during the course of duty, to chemicals involved with the production of methamphetamine. I certifo that this project does not have a direct and foreseeable effect on the pecuniary interests of me or my spouse, Consistent with the Republican Leadership's policy on earmarks, I hereby certify that to the best of my knowledge this request (I) is not directed to an entity or program that will be named after a sitting Member of Congress; (2) is not intended to be used by an entity to secure funds for other entities unless the use of funding is consistent with the specified purpose of the earmark; and (3) meets or exceeds all statutory requirements for matching funds where applicable. I further certify that should this request be included in the bill, I will place a statement in the Congressional Record describing how the funds will be spent and justifying the use of federal taxpayer funds. Sincerely,\n\n\

    Dear Chai=an Mollohan and Ranking Member Wolf: I am requesting funding for the Youth Soccer Gang Prevention Initiative in fiscal year 2010. The entity to receive funding under the Department of Justice, Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention is the Starfinder Foundation, located at the Urban Promise Center, 4015 Main Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 19127. The funding would be used to demonstrate the effectiveness of using soccer as a tool for keeping at-risk children and teenagers from joining gangs.. The sport of soccer is now recognized as a powerful magnet to successfully attract at-risk youth to innovative educational programs that provide positive alternatives to the negative peer pressures that so often lead to gang involvement and juvenile delinquency. Investing in youth who are at high risk for gang participation and empowering them with soccer-based leadership responsibilities and workforce development opportunities will provide a significant contribution to an environment of sustainable social change. . ' I certify that neither I nor my spouse has any fmancial interest in this project.\n\n\

The entity to receive funding under the Department of Justice, Edward Byrne Grant program is the City of Philadelphia, Managing Director's Office, located at 1401 John F.

    Dear Chairman Obey and Ranking Member Lewis: I am requesting funding for Management of Offenders with Co-occuring Mental Illness and Addiction Disorders in fiscal year 2010. The entity to receive funding for this project is Alachua County, 12 South East 1st Street, Gainesville, FL, 32601. It is my understanding that the funding would be used for an integrated, coordinated continuum of care using evidenced based practices where there will be no wrong door to enter treatment. Persons will be assessed and provided with a level of treatment consistent with individual need. This innovative approach could prove to be an effective keystone to alleviate jail overcrowding by reducing the recidivism rate prevalent with offenders suffering from mental illness compounded by drug abuse. I certifY that this project does not have a direct and foreseeable effect on the pecuniary interests of my spouse or me. Consistent with the Republican Leadership's policy on earmarks, I hereby certifY that to the best of my knowledge this request: (1) is not directed to an entity or program that will be named after a sitting Member of Congress [OR: was named after Representative John Doe in 1983J; (2) is not intended to be used by an entity to secure funds for other entities unless the use of funding is consistent with the specified purpose of the earmark; and (3) meets or exceeds all statutory requirements for matching funds where applicable. I further certifY that should this request be included in the bill, I will place a statement in the Congressional Record describing how the funds will be spent and justifYing the use of federal taxpayer funds.

This request will fund the acquisition of interoperable radios for the Colmar Manor Police Department. Without these new radios, Colmar Manor officers will not have the ability to receive and handle calls for police service.

    March 30, 2009 The Honorable David R. Obey, Chair The Honorable Jerry Lewis, Ranking Member Committee on Appropriations H218, The Capitol Washington, D.C. 20515 Dear Chair Obey and Ranking Member Lewis: I am requesting funding for Gunshot Location System in fiscal year 2010. The entity to receive funding for this project is the San Pablo, CA Police Department, located at 13880 San Pablo Ave. , San Pablo, CA 94806. Funding would be used by the San Pablo Police Depar1ment to purchase networked sensors that will be placed at specific coordinates on buildings and telephone poles to accurately detect and locate the origin of gunshots and weapons-events. Last year the City saw a significant increase in its homicide rate and the City'S police force is stretched beyond its means as they attempt to respond to crime and gang violence. An increased coverage area will assist both San Pablo and Richmond, CA, police departments in fighting violence. Neighboring Richmond is already purchasing and implementing the system. I ce11ify that neither r nor my spouse has any financial interest in this project. Sincerely,\n\n\

    The Honorable Jerry Lewis Ranking Member House Appropriations Committee 1016 Longworth HOB Washington, DC 20515\n\n\
    I write to respectfully request funding in the Fiscal Year 2010 Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies Appropriations bill, Department of Justice, Juvenile Justice account. The entity to receive funding for this project is the ARISE Foundation, located at 4001 Edmund Benson Boulevard, Miami, FL 33178. The funding would be used to educate at-risk youth. Established in 1986, ARISE has trained over 5,800 certified life skills instructors who have gone on to teach over 4,000,000 documented hours of evidence-based life skills lessons. Specifically targeting high-risk youth, ARISEs goal is to stop the cycle of crime and violence while offenders are young enough to learn life lessons - and ultimately, to reduce rates of recidivism, drug abuse and violence while building skills to keep juveniles in school and out of harms way. The ARISE Life Management Skills Lessons provide both training and program materials for teaching such lessons to incarcerated youth through interactive methods that help develop positive social and emotional skills needed to break the cycle of violence and crime that would otherwise doom many of today' s juvenile offenders. Further, it provides demonstrable outcome measures on the value of expanding this statistically proven, award-winning, professionally managed intervention program. I certify that this project does not have a direct andforeseeable effect on the pecuniary interests of me or my spouse.\n\n\

    The Honorable Jerry Lewis Ranking Member House Committee on Appropriations 1016 Longworth House Off. Bldg. Washington, DC 20515\n\n\
    I am requesting $700,000 for The Covenant House of Florida in fiscal year 2010. The entity to receive funding for this project is the Covenant House of Florida at 5931 East Colonial Drive, Orlando, Florida 32807. The funding would be used for The Covenant House of Florida to establish a Parenting Education and Health Support program that will serve pregnant or parenting homeless teen mothers in central Florida. This project will provide a specialized curriculum for runaway and homeless youth (teen mothers and fathers) on parenting and parenthood, childbirth, infant feeding and breastfeeding promotion, baby care basics, and education regarding risky behavior and other risk factors that may result in harm to fetuses and newborns (i.e, tobacco, alcohol and drug use). This is a good use of taxpayers' dollars because educating disconnected youth who are young parents, particularly runaways, is essential to a healthy and safe developmental start for their children and a way to prevent these children from repeating the lifestyle mistakes. 1 certify that neither 1 nor my spouse has any financial interest in this project.\n\n\
    Sincerely,\n\n\

The entity to receive funding for this project is the City of National City, located at: 1243 National City Boulevard, National City, CA 91950. Funding would be used to create a city-wide task force to address homeless issues, fund a full-time social service worker, and fund a part-time Psychological Emergency Response Team clinician. This project deserves federal funding because it would enable National City to address the influx in homeless persons, particularly trans-border migrants and their families, as well as help low-income families. I certify that neither I nor my spouse has any financial interest in this project.\n\n\

The WSMI program propagated an effective treatment model to deal with the severity of the drug and created-\"Meth Action Teams\" (MATs) in every county, educating and organizing communities to combat the drug and all its related effects at the grassroots. I certify that this project does not have a direct and foreseeable effect on the pecuniary interests of my spouse or me. I hereby certify that this request will be made publicly available on my official congressional website as required by Chairman Obey's new Committee policy that only posted requests will be considered. Consistent with the Republican Conference's policy on project requests, I hereby certify that to the best of my knowledge this request: (I) is not directed to an entity or program that will be named after a sitting Member of Congress; (2) is not intended to be used by an entity to secure funds for other entities unless the use of funding is consistent with the specified purpose of the earmark; and (3) meets or exceeds all statutory requirements for matching funds where applicable. I further certify that should this request be included in the bill, I will place a statement in the Congressional Record describing how the funds will be spent and justifying the use of federal taxpayer funds. Sincerely,\n\n\

    The Honorable David R. Obey, Chairman The Honorable JetTY Lewis, Ranking Member Committee on Appropriations H-218, The Capitol Washington, D.C. 20515 Dear Chairman Obey and Ranking Member Lewis: I ant requesting funding for KidsPeace: KidsPeace Ithaca Therapeutic Foster Care Program in fiscal year 2010. The entity to receive funding for this project is: KidsPeace c/o 4184 Seneca Street, Suite 212 West Seneca, NY 14224 KidsPeace requests one-time start-up funding to establish a therapeutic foster care pro grant in the Ithaca area. The program will address a critical tTiplicate need: (1) providing community-based placement to children involved with or at risk for involvement with the juvenile justice system; (2) addressing the mental health needs of children in the social service system; and (3) providing safe and supportive homes to children. KidsPeace, a 127-year-old children's charity, requests one-time start up funds to establish a therapeutic foster care pro grant in the Ithaca region to provide communitybased placement to children at risk for juvenile justice involvement while addressing their mental health needs. In fact, for every dollar spent on therapeutic foster care, an estimated $14 is saved in court and corrections system costs. Therefore, a one-time investment of$350,000 can potentially save the federal goverrunent and the state of New York nearly $5 million. I certify that neither I nor my spouse has any financial interest in this project. Thank you for your consideration of my request.\n\n\

    I am requesting $500,000 for the Joint First Responders Training Facility. The entity to receive funding for this project is the City of Carlsbad located at: 1200 Carlsbad Village Drive Carlsbad, CA 92008 With the most traveled international border in the world, large number of military installations, an international airport, a major tourist destination and an internationally used port, San Diego County is a prime example of a major terrorist target. Under this project, the Carlsbad police, fire, public works and other regional public safety organizations, including the FBI and DEA, would be able to utilize a single, state-of-the-art training facility to accommodate all their needs. The first phase of development for the regional law enforcement training facility is to procure the technology for advanced training. The funding requested at this time will acquire a targeting computer system, software for shooting range target controls and simulation for shooting practice as well as compurer controls for bum props and smoke generators for training.

    Dear Chairman Obey and Ranking Member Lewis: I am requesting funding for the Newport News Police Department Gunshot Location System. The entity to receive funding for this project is the City of Newport News, Virginia located at 2400 Washington Avenue, 3rd Floor, Newport News, VA 23607. The Funds will be used to purchase networked sensors which will be placed at specific coordinates on buildings and telephone poles to accurately detect and locate the origin of gunshots and weapons-events. Once a gunshot is detected, ShotSpotter calculates the position where the gun was fired and sends the data to a central server accessible by lawenforcement agencies. Because ShotSpotter uses computer software to analyze sounds, it is precise enough to ignore noises that could be mistaken for gunfire. I certify that I have no financial interest in this project.

The entity to receive funding for this project is University of Arizona, located at 1401 East University Boulevard, Tucson, AZ, 85721. The funding would be used for: This project will create a new model for standardizing the counting, processing, identification, and handling of UBC decedents across the U.S. border with Mexico and will create a handbook for expert training of coroners and medical examiners who continue to struggle with this unprecedented problem. BMI will also produce between 5-10 training workshops for border coroners and medical examiners. The U.S. is experiencing a humanitarian crisis of unauthorized border crossers (UBCs) suffering and dying in the southwestern deserts while trying to enter the U.S. from Mexico. Policymakers and government agencies are not accurately counting, processing, or identifying these men, women, and children. These entities are unable to accurately measure the efficacy of various government strategies designed to reduce the number of such deaths. The Binational Migration Institute (BMI) leads the way for creating reliable information about these deaths across the entire U.S.-Mexico border which facilitates better understand of the relationship between U.S. immigration control policies and UBC deaths. I certify that neither I nor my spouse has any financial interest in this project.

    Dear Chairma n Obey and Ranking Member Lewis: I am requesti ng fund ing for a Family Visitation Center in fiscal yea r 2010. The entity to receive funding for this project is: Alameda County Social Services 2000 San Pablo Avenue Oakland, CA 946 12 The funding would be used for establishing a family visitation center, the primary goal of which is to reunite children with the birth parent, with an ex pected outcome of reducing the reentry of families into the foster care system that successfully reunify. Typically, the various levels of government (federal, state, and local) become the parents of last resort to foster children, which is the most expensive and least efficient means of meeting the needs of abused and neglected children. Therefore, the establishment of a family visitation center embraces the concept of family and the rebuilding of families as the most cost-effective, nurturing and viable way of addressing the needs of abused and neglected children ..\n\n\
    I certify that neither I nor my spouse has any financial interest in this project.\n\n\

    Dear Chairman Mollohan and Ranking Member Wolf: I am requesting funding in the FYIO Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations bill, under the Byrne Grant program for the Harris County, TX Constable Precinct 4, located at 16000 Stuebner Airline Road, Suite 520, Spring, TX 77379. It is my understanding that the funding would be used to support an investigating deputy to handle violent crimes against women. The investigating deputy will follow-up on cases, assist in locating suspects, and serve protective orders. The investigating deputy shall follow-up on cases that have become dormant, and work on cases where the suspect has never been brought to justice. I certifY that neither I nor my spouse has any financial interest in this project. Consistent with the Republican Leadership's policy on earmarks, I hereby certifY that to the best of my knowledge this request (1) is not directed to an entity or program that will be named after a sitting Member of Congress; (2) is not intended to be used by an entity to secure funds for other entities unless the use of funding is consistent with the specified purpose of the earmark; and (3) meets or exceeds all statutory requirements for matching funds where applicable. I further certify that should this request be included in the bill, I will place a statement in the Congressional Record describing how the funds will be spent and justifYing the use of federal taxpayer funds. Sincerely,\n\n\
