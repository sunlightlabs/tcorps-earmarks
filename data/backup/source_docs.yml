    Ranking Member Jerry Lewis House Appropriations Committee 1016 Longworth House Office Building Washington, DC 20515\n\n\
    Dear Chairman Obey & Ranking Member Lewis: I am requesting $3,000,000.00 for the Hotline Services for Victims of Sexual Violence and Rape Prevention Programs in fiscal year 2010. The entity to receive funding for this project is Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network, located at 2000 L Street NW, Suite 406, Washington, DC 20036. The funding would be used to operate two national hotlines for rape victims as well as RAINN\xE2\x80\x99s public education and outreach programs. Taxpayer Justification: This 3-part anti-sexual assault initiative, authorized at $3 million annually under Sec. 628 of the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act, includes two national hotlines for rape victims as well as RAINN\xE2\x80\x99s public education and outreach programs. Every 2.5 minutes, another American is sexually assaulted. The more victims RAINN helps, the more rapists will be brought to justice: victims who get counseling are more likely to report to police and more likely to follow through to prosecution. I certify that neither I nor my spouse has any direct financial interest in this project. Also, I hereby certify that this request will be made publicly available on my Official Website as required by Chairman Obey\xE2\x80\x99s new Committee policy that only posted requests will be considered.

    BARNES - AASTAD\n\n\
    Research Initiatives in Support of USDA-ARS The North Central Soil Conservation Research Lab., Morris, MN (NCSCRL) Statement of The Barnes-Aastad Soil & Water Conservation Research Association\n\n\
    The research program at the NCSCRL experienced a flat budget and a drastic loss of scientific expertise during the last 10 years. The need is urgent to re-invigorate this stand-alone research unit and re-build a strong and integrated crops/soils research program at the Lab. The scientific and applied research carried out by this Lab serves and benefits a wide range of stakeholders and customers, not only in the immediate rural communities, but throughout the Midwest and the rest of the nation. The diminishing budget and loss of scientific expertise will force the research lab to be less focused on field and on-farm research with immediate and direct economic, environmental and developmental benefits to farmers, producers and the rural communities. Therefore, and in support of the Lab\xE2\x80\x99s mission, the Barnes-Aastad Association requests permanent funding in 2010 to fill four research positions (research agricultural economist, research hydrologist, climate change scientist and cropping systems ecologist). A stakeholders\xE2\x80\x99 meeting in 2008 identified these positions to help improve the economic return to agricultural producers and enhance sustainability of agricultural enterprises in the upper Midwest. Also, these positions will help reinvigorate an interdisciplinary research team after the loss of four research oppositions during the last seven years. The agricultural economist is needed to provide farmers and the local communities with badly needed research-based answers and solutions to production problems leading to the degradation and depreciation of natural resources that support the development of agriculture and rural America. The research hydrologist will provide farmers and producers with a better understanding of the quantity, quality and dynamics of water resources in relation to soil and landscape characteristics and management practices, especially in biomass production for bioenergy, and will help farmers achieve the double objective of maximum sustainable yields and maximum long-term profit of their operations. The climate change research scientist will help consolidate the unique position of the Lab in Morris to collect, evaluate and quantify data on carbon storage and ecosystem effects across a unique range of soil types, climate, and farm management systems. Finally, the cropping systems ecologist is needed to apply ecological scientific principles to the design and management of sustainable agro-ecosystems in a holistic approach, linking ecology, socioeconomics, and culture to help sustain agricultural production and environmental health.\n\n\

  plain_text: "19 March, 2009 Congressman Collin Peterson 2211 Rayburn HOB Washington, DC 20515 Reference: FY10 Project Request Titled \xE2\x80\x9CPolaris Defense Ultra Light Utility Vehicles (ULUVs) For The National Guard\xE2\x80\x9D Congressman Peterson, Polaris respectfully submitted an FY10 Project request for the purchase of Ultra Light Utility Vehicles (ULUVs) For The National Guard. In December of 2008, the National Guard added Ultra Light Utility Vehicles to their FY10 \xE2\x80\x9CTop 25\xE2\x80\x9D Equipment Modernization Shortfall List. Signed by LTG Clyde Vaughn, Chief of the Army National Guard, this addition to the Top 25 list confirms the critical need for lighter, smaller, more cost effective vehicles to perform logistics and support functions, as well as homeland security functions, both at home and in the Global War on Terrorism. This request provides funding for Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) All Terrain Ultra Light Utility Vehicles (ULUV) - which can and do meet this critical need today. This request Provides Value For The Taxpayer because: \xEF\x82\xB7 ULUVs Are Affordable And Cost Effective\xE2\x80\x93 at less than $20k unit cost\xE2\x80\x93 they are a fraction of the cost of one HMMWV. These vehicles can do a number of the missions currently being accomplished using the HMMWV, cheaper, and in many cases better \xE2\x80\x93 freeing them up for combat critical missions. Dual Use Nature Of ULUVs Well Suited For Needs Of The National Guard - As the Guard is called upon to go to war, as well as called upon at home, the DUAL USE nature of these vehicles make the need all the greater. 14 States have expressed a need for these vehicles, including South Dakota. Many TAGs have written letters to LTG Clyde Vaughn in support of the purchase of ULUVs. ULUVs Provide Mission Flexibility - ULUVs are highly capable, highly versatile vehicles that will continue to be needed to support Defense Department, State and Homeland Security operations and have been used extensively by all the Services in both CONUS and OCONUS operations. With the ability to operate in rugged off road conditions, at high altitudes without modification, these vehicles have truly gone wherever our forces wanted to go. They have been used in the homeland mission for drug interdiction, perimeter security, range control, flight-line support, MPs, base ops, public works and many other missions. ULUVs Have A Lighter Environmental Footprint \xE2\x80\x93 Given ULUVs are significantly smaller and lighter than Humvees, SUVs and Trucks, they have a significantly lighter environmental footprint. This is important on test ranges, training sites and many other areas where the National Guard operates.\n\n\

    This project is a good example of why the earmark process can be effectively utilized to field vehicles that are needed and supported by the National Guard , but given they don\xE2\x80\x99t have their own procurement budgets, some times takes many years to accomplish. Funding this project will accomplish this sooner, and help provide fuel to maintain Polaris as a world leader in off-road vehicles, both for the military and commercial markets. Thank you for your support,\n\n\

Consistent with the Republican Leadership\xE2\x80\x99s policy on earmarks, I hereby certify that to the best of my knowledge this request (1) is not directed to an entity or program that will be named after a sitting Member of Congress; (2) is not intended to be used by an entity to secure funds for other entities unless the use of funding is consistent with the specified purpose of the earmark; and (3) meets or exceeds all statutory requirements for matching funds where applicable. I further certify that should this request be included in the bill, I will place a statement in the Congressional Record describing how the funds will be spent and justifying the use of federal taxpayer funds. Sincerely,\n\n\
    A\n\
