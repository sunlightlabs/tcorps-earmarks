    Ranking Member Jerry Lewis House Appropriations Committee 1016 Longworth House Office Building Washington, DC 20515\n\n\
    Dear Chairman Obey & Ranking Member Lewis: I am requesting $3,000,000 for Army Responsive Tactical Space System Exerciser (ARTSSE) in fiscal year 2010. The entity to receive funding for this project is J2 Technologies Inc., located at 4801 University Square, Suite 31 Huntsville, AL 35816-1815.

Taxpayer Justification: Army Responsive Tactical Space System Exerciser (ARTSSE) provides technologies critical to maintaining access to space. ARTSSE supports an unfunded Army need to provide a responsive surge for space based communication, surveillance, and reconnaissance, especially when a change in circumstances brought about by foreign-owned assets requires a response from the U.S. systems within hours or a few days in order to maintain protection of U.S. personnel and assets. Also, I hereby certify that this request will be made publicly available on my Official Website as required by Chairman Obey\xE2\x80\x99s new Committee policy that only posted requests will be considered. Consistent with the Republican Leadership\xE2\x80\x99s policy on earmarks, I hereby certify that to the best of my knowledge this request (1) is not directed to an entity or program that will be named after a sitting Member of Congress; (2) is not intended to be used by an entity to secure funds for other entities unless the use of funding is consistent with the specified purpose of the earmark; and (3) meets or exceeds all statutory requirements for matching funds where applicable. I further certify that should this request be included in the bill, I will place a statement in the Congressional Record describing how the funds will be spent and justifying the use of federal taxpayer funds.

    Chairman David Obey House Appropriations Committee H-218, the Capitol Washington, DC 20515\n\n\
    Ranking Member Jerry Lewis House Appropriations Committee 1016 Longworth House Office Building Washington, DC 20515\n\n\
    Dear Chairman Obey & Ranking Member Lewis: I am requesting $1,000,000.00 for the Zerometh Drug Prevention Campaign in fiscal year 2010. The entity to receive funding for this project is the Alabama District Attorneys Association, located at 515 South Perry Street Montgomery, Alabama 36104. The funding would be used by Zerometh to expose meth and its deadly consequences to teens and young adults. The goal is to stop a potential first-time user from ever trying the drug, while encouraging everyone to look for the warning signs and support treatment. Taxpayer Justification: Meth is a national epidemic and efforts to educate youth on its dangers and hopefully prevent the initial use of meth are needed. I certify that neither I nor my spouse has any direct financial interest in this project. Also, I hereby certify that this request will be made publicly available on my Official Website as required by Chairman Obey\xE2\x80\x99s new Committee policy that only posted requests will be considered. Consistent with the Republican Leadership\xE2\x80\x99s policy on earmarks, I hereby certify that to the best of my knowledge this request (1) is not directed to an entity or program that will be named after a sitting Member of Congress; (2) is not intended to be used by an entity to secure funds for other entities unless the use of funding is consistent with the specified purpose of the earmark; and (3) meets or exceeds all statutory requirements for matching funds where applicable. I further certify that should this request be included in the bill, I will place a statement in the Congressional Record describing how the funds will be spent and justifying the use of federal taxpayer funds. Sincerely,\n\n\
    A\n\

    Ranking Member Jerry Lewis House Appropriations Committee 1016 Longworth House Office Building Washington, DC 20515\n\n\
    Dear Chairman Obey & Ranking Member Lewis: I am requesting $350,000.00 for Alabama Center for Advanced Woodworking Technology in fiscal year 2010. The entity to receive funding for this project is Alabama Technology Network, located at 500 Beacon Parkway West, Birmingham AL 35209. The funding would be used to assist with the renovation, wiring, and expansion of an existing building. The renovation would provide a new location in the facility to house the woodworking facility. The funds would also be used to provide for the physical relocation of the equipment from its current location. Taxpayer Justification: The purpose of the funding is to facilitate the growth and development of Alabama's secondary wood processing industries and be a part of local, state and national efforts to recruit, train and retain wood related industries. I certify that neither I nor my spouse has any direct financial interest in this project.
